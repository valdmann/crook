This is "crook" - a simple experimental file compressor.  Being
experimental you probably shouldn't use it to compress important data.
For ease of distribution the source code is condensed into a single
file.

Crook can be considered a variant of the PPM algorithm, except it
works with a binary alphabet and so does not need to use escapes.
Instead of escapes it uses information inheritance to blend statistics
from different orders.  See crook.cpp for more information.
